Little joke WADS I made when I was talking with a group of friends.

LessLights and AllLights (no not that kayne song) were shitpost mods that I made with a group of friends when we were joking around with the idea of "Less Lights"
Supports any map that only has 120 sector tags or less.

More Lights Bisexual was a joke mod I made when someone in a Discord call brought up Bisexual lighting for More Lights. After making a small map that had it via Doom Builder's sector lighting, I decided to make a kinda-universal version for my speed modding challenge back in 2021.
Only supports Doom and Doom 2. 

Blah blah don't expect these to get updated
