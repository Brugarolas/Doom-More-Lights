More Lights is a mod for ZDoom hardware accelerated ports that adds more dynamic lighting effects to most IWads and mods.

# Download links
To download from Github, simply head to the releases tab and select the latest version. Then download the zip.

More Lights can also be found on the [ZDoom Forums,](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=72206) both the Github and ZDoom Forums pages are updated instantly when new updates are released. 

There's also a page on [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/more-lights), although this isn't recommened as it takes me a long time to update More Lights there.
